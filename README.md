# Get the Geo Location of an IP Address

Time for a script again, this one will geolocate an IP address based on input from the user. For this script, we will be using a bunch of Python modules to accomplish this. First we make a check to see that the user puts in enough arguments, and if not, they 'usage' variable will be printed on how to use it. We are using the geody web service to find geolocate the IP.
